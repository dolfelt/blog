Welcome to my humble place on the Internet. I strive to always be a **servant**, am fortunate to be a **husband**, and forever blessed to be a **father**. 

I love progress and hate standing still. Finely crafted homes, and [building](http://omyfamilyblog.com/2012/04/welcome-to-my-crazy/) [them](http://omyfamilyblog.com/2012/12/our-chalkboard-kitchen-table/), are a weak spot, as is turning [old](http://omyfamilyblog.com/2010/09/upstairs-remodel-before-picture-edition/) into [new](http://omyfamilyblog.com/2012/01/decorate-my-second-story-for-me-will-you/). My mind thinks in solutions, and that's fine by me, especially when I have problems.

I also happen to be working at a pretty great company. At [When I Work](http://wheniwork.com), we are very forward thinking about how businesses and hourly workers should experience technology. We strive to bring consumer UXpectations to a business world.
